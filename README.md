# EEL-Compiler

EEL (Early Experimental Language) is a small programming language. It supports functions and procedures, parameter passing by reference and value, recursive calls, and other structures. It also allows nesting in the declaration of functions and procedures. However, it does not support basic programming tools such as the "for" structure or data types like real numbers and strings.
